\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}
According to the authors \cite{main-paper}, a theory solver based procedure described in the previous sections, is implemented as part of SMT solver CVC4. The string alphabet $\mathcal{A}$ for this implementation is the set of all 256 ASCII characters. An experimental comparison with two other the string solvers was conducted. The other string solvers are Z3-STR \cite{Z3_str} and Kaluza \cite{Kaluza}. These two solvers are widely used in security analysis. For the evaluation, 47,284 benchmark problems from a set of about 50K benchmarks generated by Kudzu \cite{Kudzu} were used. These benchmarks were translated into CVC4’s extension of the SMT-LIB format and into the Z3-STR format. In the paper \cite{main-paper}, it is claimed that, CVC4’s string solver performed better. More detail on the evaluation can be found in \cite{main_phd}.
