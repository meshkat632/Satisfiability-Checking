\section{Solving string and length constraints}
\label{sec:Solving string and length constraints}

In this section, we will describe the approach based on algebraic techniques for solving (quantifier-free) constraints natively over a theory of unbounded strings with length. This techniques is used to construct string solvers that can be integrated into general, multi-theory SMT solvers based on the DPLL(T ) architecture \cite{dpll_t}. Which enables the solver to reason about a language of mixed constraints that includes strings together with integers, reals, arrays, and algebraic datatypes.
