\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we tried to present the overview of a automatic reasoning tool for solving constraints over unbounded strings with length. We have found, the idea of implementing the string solver natively is unique. This approach allowed high interaction with core of CVC4 SMT solver. So the performance is better than others. It also allows any general purpose arithmetic solver be easily integrated. However, the application of the rules is complicated and very hard to implement. it would be better to support a richer language of string constraints that occur often in practice, especially in security applications. Such expressiveness would promote the use of such automatic reasoning tool in commercial software constructions.
