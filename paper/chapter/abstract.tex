Our modern society relies on software systems and on-line services. Most of the times these systems are dealing with our private and sensitive data. Privacy violation is one of the major concerns about such web-based applications and on-line services. To provide a more secure environment for the Internet services, these web-based applications should be tested for vulnerability. The verification procedure and security analysis of such system rely on automatic solvers, which can check the satisfiability of constraints over a rich set of data types, including character strings. String is considered as the main information carrier in web-based communication. However, most traditional mathematical methods focus more on numbers and most string solvers today are standalone tools that can reason only about some fragment of the theory of strings. In this paper we will describe a solver for the theory of unbounded strings with concatenation and length.
